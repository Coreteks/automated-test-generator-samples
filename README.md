# Automated Test Generator Results
This repository contains the output of the [Automated Test Generator](https://automated-test-generator.coreteks.org/) which was run against various popular PHP projects. This repository serves as a demonstration of the current capabilities of the tool.

**Note:** Some classes may not have their file generated. While running the generator on some classes, these required more than 128MB of RAM to generate all the test cases, exhausting the maximum amount of memory allocated to PHP. As such, were not generated.
